                Ralink/MediaTek U-Boot for MIPS SoC
        RT3052/RT3352/RT3883/RT5350/MT7620/MT7621/MT7628/MT7688
                  Based on MediaTek SDK 5.0.1.0


                            BUILD TOOLS

For MT7621 U-Boot:
- extract 'tools/mips-2012.03.tar.bz2' to /opt

For RT3XXX/MT7620/MT7628 U-Boot:
- extract 'tools/buildroot-gcc342.tar.bz2' to /opt

Both toolchains require x86 (32-bit) Linux environment.


                         BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
                         
(mips-2012.03 - 32bit, to run the copiler in 64x - install ia32-libs )
# sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

- Run 'make menuconfig', choose [Exit] and confirm [Save]. This is important step!
- Run 'make'.
- Use image file uboot.bin (ROM mode) for NOR and SPI-flash boards.
- Use image file uboot.img (RAM mode) for NAND-flash (or RT3XXX SPI-flash) boards 

To clean U-Boot tree:
- Run 'make clean'.
- Run 'make unconfig'.

NOTE:
1. U-Boot images for most ASUS devices is already builded.
2. U-Boot is configured for UART baud rate 115200.
3. All profiles has disabled option "Enable all Ethernet PHY" to prevent LAN-WAN
   spoofing (EPHY will be enabled later in FW logic). To force enable EPHY (e.g. for
   use OpenWRT/PandoraBox), select option "Enable all Ethernet PHY".


                         FLASH INSTRUCTIONS

- Upload appropriate U-Boot image file to router's /tmp dir (e.g. via WinSCP).
- Check U-Boot image checksum and compare with uboot.md5:

md5sum /tmp/uboot.bin

- Flash checked U-Boot via SSH or Telnet console (flash duration ~3 sec):

mtd_write write /tmp/uboot.bin Bootloader

- Reboot router.

                             WARNING

- Do not remove power supply during flash U-Boot!!!
- Device may be bricked due to your incorrect actions!!!
